ORID Practice:

Objective (O) [What did we learn today? What activities did you do? what scenes have impressed you?]

We learn about how to combine use AI to write user story, elevator pitch, and also how to use AI to write user journey map.

Reflection: Impressive

Interpretive:

For the lesson today I think the explanation part goes well,

Also, we have time to practice the concept we learn. But seems the homework kinda too much as we need to do a project alter on, might consider to reduce the homework.

Decision:
I will try to understand more on the React concept and adopt the concept I learn to code actual example with it.
